# üëã Hi, I'm Fares El-Basousy

I‚Äôm a Software Engineer with a Bachelor‚Äôs degree in Computer Engineering. I specialize in Full Stack Development, working mainly with the MERN stack, TypeScript, and related frameworks.
Beyond academics, I‚Äôve always enjoyed getting involved in tech communities and collaborative projects. During college, I was actively engaged in student clubs like IEEE, took part in competitions like ICPC, and contributed to organizing technical workshops. I also had the chance to help build and grow developer communities from the ground up, and participated in several hackathons along the way.
I‚Äôm passionate about writing clean, efficient code and continuously learning new things ‚Äî both through projects and from the people around me.
